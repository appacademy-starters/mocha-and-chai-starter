# UNIT TESTING PRACTICE

Don't forget to npm install!

Inside this directory you will find three sub-directories

- `problems`: contains a `dog.js` that you will be writing tests for
- `test`: contains a `dog-spec.js` file, where you will be writing tests
- `solution`: contains a `dog-spec-solution.js` file that contains my solution
  to the practice

run the specs using the command `npm test` and make sure each passes

Compare your code to our solution in the `dog-spec-solution.js` file when you're done!
